Mirror Mirror on the wall, should I live by your standard or my own? Mirror Mirror on the
wall, if I choose to be myself, am I still the fairest of all?

My interactive quiz takes my perception of how personality traits might be embodied by physical
phenomena, and projects them onto a 3D mesh sheet. Thoughtfulness, Time-management ability,
Self-control, Temperament, and Creativity are mapped to different types of movement, colours,
opacity and texture by adjusting z-coord, alpha in colors and perlin noise. Smooth animation is
achieved by Ani library and movements are detected in the same way opticalflow.pde works.
Based on your answers, this mirror will reflects how I might visualize your personality
.
In real life, we often try to hide our true selves just to become someone we think we need to be,
maybe so others like or respect us a little bit more. I observed several friends interact with my
project; some of them have seen me play with it during development. One person stepped right
for “easy to get anxious” question just because he likes the effect even though in real life he
always stays calm. Lots of people in this world already have lost their true selves because they
want to fit in; but just take a look at those creatures above - each of them is fascinating in their
own unique way. If you realize your creature is not pretty anymore, are you going to try to choose
an opposite answer just to make it better? Are you going to change any answers given a second
chance?
